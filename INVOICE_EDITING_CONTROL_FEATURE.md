# Invoice Editing Control Feature

## Overview
This feature implements important business logic to prevent modification of fabric cut details once a job work wages invoice has been submitted. This ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized changes after invoice submission.

## Key Features

### 1. Edit Restriction on Fabric Cuts
- **When**: A job work wages invoice is submitted for a warp
- **What**: Edit and delete buttons for fabric cuts associated with that warp are disabled
- **Why**: Maintains data integrity and prevents changes after invoice submission

### 2. Visual Indicators
- **Invoice Status Column**: Added to Fabric Cut List showing invoice status per warp
- **Warning Alerts**: Shows when editing is disabled in Production Summary
- **Tooltips**: Explain why buttons are disabled when hovering over them
- **Status Chips**: Color-coded indicators (Pending=Orange, Approved=Green, No Invoice=Gray)

### 3. Invoice Deletion Capability
- **Delete Button**: Added to Invoice Approval Status page
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Requires confirmation before deletion with warning message
- **Auto Re-enable**: Deleting an invoice automatically re-enables fabric cut editing
- **Real-time Updates**: Other components automatically refresh when invoice is deleted

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### New API Endpoints
1. **GET** `/api/job-work-wages/check-warp-status/:warpId`
   - Checks if a warp has submitted invoices
   - Returns pending/approved invoice counts
   - Used to determine if editing should be disabled

2. **DELETE** `/api/job-work-wages/:id`
   - Deletes a job work wages submission
   - Returns deleted submission details
   - Re-enables fabric cut editing for the warp

#### Enhanced Routes
- `routes/jobWorkWages.js`: Added new endpoints for status checking and deletion

### Frontend Changes

#### FabricCutList Component (`client/src/components/FabricCutList.js`)
- **New State**: `warpInvoiceStatus` - Map tracking invoice status per warp
- **New Functions**:
  - `checkWarpInvoiceStatus()` - Fetches invoice status for warps
  - `isEditingDisabled()` - Determines if editing should be disabled
- **Visual Updates**:
  - Added "Invoice Status" column to table
  - Disabled edit/delete buttons with tooltips when appropriate
  - Warning alert in Production Summary for warps with submitted invoices
- **Event Handling**: Listens for `invoiceDeleted` events to refresh status

#### InvoiceApprovalStatus Component (`client/src/components/InvoiceApprovalStatus.js`)
- **New State**: Delete dialog states (`deleteDialogOpen`, `submissionToDelete`, `deleting`)
- **New Functions**:
  - `handleDeleteClick()` - Opens delete confirmation dialog
  - `handleDeleteConfirm()` - Performs the deletion
  - `handleDeleteCancel()` - Cancels deletion
- **Visual Updates**:
  - Added delete button to actions column
  - Comprehensive delete confirmation dialog with submission details
  - Warning message about re-enabling fabric cut editing
- **Event Dispatch**: Fires `invoiceDeleted` event after successful deletion

## User Workflow

### Scenario 1: Normal Fabric Cut Editing
1. User creates fabric cuts for a warp
2. Edit/delete buttons are enabled (green/red icons)
3. User can modify quantities and delete cuts as needed

### Scenario 2: After Invoice Submission
1. User submits job work wages invoice for the warp
2. Fabric cuts for that warp show "Pending" or "Approved" status
3. Edit/delete buttons become disabled (grayed out)
4. Tooltips explain why editing is disabled
5. Production summary shows warning alert

### Scenario 3: Invoice Deletion and Re-enabling
1. User goes to Invoice Approval Status page
2. Finds the invoice they want to delete
3. Clicks delete button (red trash icon)
4. Confirms deletion in dialog (with warning message)
5. Invoice is deleted and fabric cut editing is automatically re-enabled
6. Fabric Cut List refreshes to show updated status

## Security and Data Integrity

### Safeguards
- **Confirmation Required**: Delete dialog prevents accidental deletions
- **Clear Warnings**: Users understand consequences of their actions
- **Audit Trail**: Backend logs all invoice deletions
- **Real-time Updates**: UI immediately reflects status changes

### Business Logic Enforcement
- **No Backdoor Editing**: Impossible to edit fabric cuts with submitted invoices
- **Consistent State**: All components stay synchronized
- **Clear Feedback**: Users always understand current state and restrictions

## Technical Benefits

### Performance
- **Batch Status Checking**: Efficient API calls for multiple warps
- **Smart Caching**: Invoice status cached until refresh needed
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Only relevant components refresh when needed

### Maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between business logic and UI
- **Reusable Functions**: Status checking logic can be used elsewhere
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established component patterns

### User Experience
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users immediately understand what they can/cannot do
- **Helpful Tooltips**: Explain restrictions without cluttering UI
- **Smooth Interactions**: No unexpected behavior or confusing states

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Bulk Invoice Operations**: Select and delete multiple invoices
2. **Invoice Edit History**: Track who deleted what and when
3. **Role-based Permissions**: Different users may have different deletion rights
4. **Notification System**: Email alerts when invoices are deleted
5. **Backup and Restore**: Ability to restore accidentally deleted invoices

### Configuration Options
- **Admin Override**: Special permission to edit despite submitted invoices
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Lock editing after certain time periods
- **Department-specific Rules**: Different rules for different types of warps

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Invoice Submission Flow**: Verify editing gets disabled after submission
2. **Invoice Deletion Flow**: Verify editing gets re-enabled after deletion
3. **Multiple Warps**: Test with warps in different invoice states
4. **Concurrent Users**: Ensure real-time updates work across sessions
5. **Error Handling**: Test network failures and edge cases

### Validation Points
- Edit buttons disabled when expected
- Status indicators show correct information
- Delete confirmations work properly
- Real-time updates occur correctly
- Performance remains acceptable with many warps

## Conclusion

This feature significantly improves the application's business logic compliance and data integrity. It prevents unauthorized changes while providing clear mechanisms for legitimate modifications through invoice deletion. The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and follows established patterns for easy maintenance and future enhancement.
